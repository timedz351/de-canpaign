## About
is an app where you are able to choose from a set of billboards from local czech and slovak political campaigns and then freely and anonymously digitally vandalize them. These creations are then saved to a gallery and presented on an extra monitor. Users would interact with the app using a graphic tablet with acces to spray or marker with option to turn on/off drips. 

It is a semestral project within a PV259 - Gennerative Design Programming which will be then presented on a exhibition.
Developed using p5.js, react, node.

### Goal
Make people heard. Share their opinions, creativity and knowledge via a somewhat cool and unorthodox way.

Platform that combines art, political expression, freedom of speech, and community interaction.

### Assumptions
- common hatred connects people ðŸ¤ª
- engagement  on multiple levels: 
   - politics
   - inexperience with graffiti - curiosity
   - experimenting/fun
- people like to get rid of frustration, maybe an interesting way to do it?
- everybody has a bit anarchistic/anti-system side to them, so this may release it; 
   - if not, they will realize they have it
